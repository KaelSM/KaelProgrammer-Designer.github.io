# Standby Screen

The screen is for a project coming soon, passing images from where I have been in my travels while studying

## Contact form
the html for the contact form is commented, as well as the php for it and js for it as they will auth for email address and php to send the form to your email.

```bash
 Signup Form 
			<form id="signup-form" method="post" action="#">
				<input type="email" name="email" id="email" placeholder="Email Address" />
				<input type="submit" value="Sign Up" />
			</form>
		
```
just need to uncomment the portion named Signup Form and customize it to your own.

## Usage

there is 2 main things, you may want the images to be url based or local based, it cycles through 3 images, but you can add more if needed, with a fade out effect to black.
```
you will be looking for "Slideshow Background" 
in the js where you can set the url, and the delay between the images

```
